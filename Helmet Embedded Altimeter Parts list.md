# Purpose #

The primary thing that skydivers are required to be aware of at all times is their altitude. In various disciplines such as freeflying and wingsuiting the standard wrist mounted altimeter can be hard to see. Skydivers often use audible altimeters which play a tone when the skydiver approaches preset altitudes. These altimeters are only capable of notifying the skydiver as they approach their deployment and emergency altitudes. They do not have any affordance for maintaining awareness throughout the majority of the skydive. The altimeter that I am building fits inside the right or left audible pocket in most skydiving helmets and places a 1.8" display in the corner of the user's peripheral vision. The display shows the current altitude which can be read at a glance without a change in body position which might otherwise effect the skydiver's flight attitude.

By combining a GPS and microSD card slot, the altimeter also give athletes the ability to analyze their performance by graphing their vertical airspeed, horizontal track, and glide ratio once they are on the ground.
